- 👋 Hi, I’m @simon-maurice
- 👀 I’m interested in C# and Windows Proramming despite only now switching to Windows for the first time ever (over 30 years on BSD Unix systems). My computing history goes all the way back to Apple II -> Commodore 64 -> Amiga -> NetBSD / FreeBSD -> OpenBSD (Also MacOS X in parallel for maybe 10 years) -> Windows on the desktop with OpenBSD for servers. I code in C, C#, Tcl, Perl, Pascal, Objective-C, Swift plus a range of others over the years including COBOL, Modula-2, & Modula-3. Modula-3 was the best programming language that I used I think, somehow it flowed the way my brain works 🤷‍♂️. Notably absent is Python; I just plain don't like that language and definitely has a real kludge feel.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and Windows Desktop programming
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that sparks my interest
- 📫 How to reach me on GitHub
