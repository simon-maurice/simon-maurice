- 👋 Hi, I’m @simon-maurice
- 👀 My computing history goes all the way back to Apple II -> Commodore 64 -> Amiga -> NetBSD / FreeBSD -> OpenBSD (Also MacOS X in parallel for maybe 10 years) -> OpenBSD everywhere. I code (or have coded) in C, Tcl, Perl, Pascal, Objective-C, Swift plus a range of others over the years including COBOL, Modula-2, & Modula-3. Modula-3 was the best programming language that I used I think, somehow it flowed the way my brain works 🤷‍♂️. Notably absent is Python; I just plain don't like that language and definitely has a real kludge feel.
- 😮 Lets start the flame wars: SQLite should be linked into just about any any application (I bet I can find a use for it in ls, cp, mv), I believe Fossil is the best SCM tool on the planet, PostgreSQL is the beginning and the end of all server relational databases, I think that whole Wayland crap on GNU/Linux is a solution looking for a problem, GNU Emacs (with properly configured init file & associated code) is the best editor on the damn planet - only need to replace emacs Lisp with Tcl and then I'll be the happiest programmer on the planet.
- 🌱 Also developing a graphing/charting library for X11 to ultimately develop a Metastock-like program to OpenBSD. Also in the ground phase of developing a personal finance type of thing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that sparks my interest
